# Dig into the blood

It's a PNG image. It means something could be easily “hidden” in a
custom tag…  but it isn't. Opened the image in Gimp, let's try and see
if there's something odd in the pixels. After playing a little bit
with brightness and contrast, the next thing to do is to separate the
RGB component and search something there.

Playing with the contrast in the Red component, you can see something:
a writing, which is the flag.

Likely *dig into the blood* was a clue to look into the red component.
